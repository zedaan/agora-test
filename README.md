# Implement authentication with Video SDK

Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. Agora uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they access Agora SD-RTN to join Video Calling. Each token is valid for a limited period and works only for a specific channel. For example, you cannot use the token generated for a channel called AgoraChannel to join the
AppTest channel.
This page shows you how to quickly set up an authentication token server, retrieve a token from
the server, and use it to connect securely to a specific Video Calling channel.

# Understand the tech
An authentication token is a dynamic key that is valid for a maximum of 24 hours. On request, a token server returns an authentication token that is valid to join a specific channel.
When users attempt to connect to an Agora channel from your app, your app retrieves a token from the token server in your security infrastructure. Your app then sends this token to Agora SD- RTN for authentication. Agora SD-RTN validates the token and reads the user and project information stored in the token. A token contains the following information:

* The [App ID](http://localhost:3000) App ID of your Agora project
* The [App certificate](http://localhost:3000) 
* The channel name
* The user ID of the user to be authenticated (optional)
* The privilege of the user, either as a publisher or a subscriber The Unix timestamp showing when the token will expire

The following figure shows the call flow you need to implement to create step-up-authentication with Agora Video Calling:

# Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

1. Open the project you created in Get Started with Video Calling.
2. Log in to your [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account.

# Project setup

To integrate token authentication into your app, do the following:

1. Open the project you created in [Get Started with Video Calling](http://localhost:3000)
2. Log in to your [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account.

# Implement the authentication workflow

In the Get Started project you implemented, the app uses an authentication token obtained manually from Agora Console to join a channel. In a production environment, your app retrieves this token from a token server. This section shows you how to:

1. Create and run a token server
2. Retrieve and use tokens from a token server

# Create and run a token server

This section shows you how to deploy a token server on Heroku.

1. Click here and deploy a token server to Heroku.
    Heroku retrieves the project code and necessary files from Github and takes you to a Create New App page. On this page, fill in the following information:
    i. app-name: A name for your token server, containing only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes.
    ii. APP_CERTIFICATE:
